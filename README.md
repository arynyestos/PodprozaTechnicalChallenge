# Podproza Technical Challenge

In October of 2024 I was in the selection process for a Blockchain Intelligence Analyst role at [Podproza](https://www.podproza.cz/). After the first interview, I was given a technical challenge that required me to do some onchain analysis of the Bitcoin chain using Python.

In this repo you can find both the Jupyter notebook (although GitHub cannot render it) and a PDF export of my solutions for the challenge.
