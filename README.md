# Podproza Technical Challenge

In October of 2024 I was in the selection process for a Blockchain Intelligence Analyst role at [Podproza](https://www.podproza.cz/). After the first interview, I was given a technical challenge that required me to do some onchain analysis of the Bitcoin chain using Python.

Although a stronger candidate was selected for the role, I very much enjoyed both the interviews and this challenge, in which I got the chance to dive deeper into the Bitcoin blockchain and its UTXOs :relaxed: :smiley:

In this repo you can find both the Jupyter notebook (although GitHub cannot render it) and a PDF export of my solutions for the challenge.
